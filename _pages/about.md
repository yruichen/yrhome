Hi, I am **Yingrui Chen**.

I am currently a second-year undergraduate student (Sophomore) at **[Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT)](https://www.gdut.edu.cn/)**, majoring in Computer Science (or your specific major).

My research interests lie in **Computer Vision**, **Cross-Modal Learning**, and **Machine Learning**. I am particularly interested in how to enable machines to understand and reason about the world through visual and textual information.

I am actively looking for **research internships** and **collaboration opportunities**. If you are interested in my work or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via [email](chenyingrui@mails.gdut.edu.cn) or GitHub.
